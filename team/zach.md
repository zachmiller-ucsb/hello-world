# About Me
My name is Zach M, and I am a fourth year math and computer science major here at UCSB.

## A Basic Idea
Beyond basic functionality (users can enter classes manually into a calendar), I want to implement a feature that allows users to see the potential classes they could take to complete their degree, based on the classes they already have taken.
