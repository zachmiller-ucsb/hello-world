I'm a 2nd year CS major and a physics minor. I have some experience with JavaScript. I am currently learning Rust and I hope to use this in the class.

## A few ideas of mine for the project

1. Import Course Prerequistes database to warn you about incomplete pre-reqs any quarter of the 4 year schedule
2. Select a Major and a Minor to auto generate a 4 year-schedules for UCSB students
3. Option to Add specfic courses and tick off completed pre-reqs(via AP, IB or CC courses) and generate customized graduation plan
