#Nathan Hoang

I am a 3rd year transfer student from College of the Canyons. I am a CS major, while minoring in chemistry.

Languages that I know are python, java, and C++. I do not have a lot of project experience, but I am willing to learn along with you guys!

Ideas:
- Wanting to link rate my professor with the 4 year planner we are making
- Wanting to plan out your schedule and options if you can graduate earlier than planned
